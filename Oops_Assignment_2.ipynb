    "**Answer:** In Python, constructors are not inherited by child classes automatically. However, child classes can make use of constructors from parent classes through explicit calls to the parent's class's constructor using the 'super()' function. This is known as constructor chaining or constructor inheritance. The 'super()' function allows us to execute the constructor of the parent class, and we can pass arguments to the parent class's constructors as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how constructor inheritance works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. When a child class is defined, it does not automatically inherit the constructor of the parent class. Instead, the child class has its own constructors, which it can use to initialize its own attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. To include the initialization logic of the parent class's constructor, we can explicitly call the parent's class's constructor using 'super()'. This allows us to reuse the parent class's initialization code and then add additional logic specific to the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. By using 'super()', we ensure that the parent class's constructor is executed before the child class's constructors. This is important because the parent class may set up attributes or perform other tasks that child relies on.\n",

    "**Answer:** Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit. This bundling helps to protect the data from being modified by unauthorized code and promotes modularity and code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it encapsulates the data(attributes) and behavior (methods) of those objects. By defining which attributes and methods are accessible to outside code, a class enfore encapsulation.\n",

    "**Answer**: The key principles of encapsulation include access control and data hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. *Access Control:* Access control is a mechanism to define the level of visibility and interaction with the internal state (attributes) and behavior (methods) of an object. It allows us to control who can access and modify the attributes and methods of a class. There are three main levels of access control:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Public: Public attributes and methods are accessible from anywhere in our program. They are not restricted, and there are no access modifiers. In Python, public attributes and methods are defined without any prefixes or underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protected: Protected attributes and methods are considered non-public, but they are a convention rather than a strict access control mechanism in Python. By convention, they are indicated with a single underscore prefix (eg., '_variable' or '_method()'). it's a way to indicate that these elements are intended for internal use within the class \n",
    "or its subclasses, but they can still be accessed from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Private: Private attributes and methods are meant to be inaccessible from outside the class. In Python, name mangling is used to make them less accessible by adding the class name as a prefix to the attribute or method name(eg., '__variable' or '__method()'). While they are not entirely private, it discourages direct access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. *Data Hiding:* Data hiding is a core aspect of encapsulation that involves restricting direct access to the internal attributes of an object. The idea is to hide the internal state of an object and provide condtrolled access throgh methods. This promotes data integrity and prevents unintended modifications to the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Benefits of data hiding:\n",
    "* It prevents external code from directly modyfying object attributes, which can help maintain the object's consistency.\n",
    "* It allows us to encapsulate complex logic within the class methods, making the class's interface more user-friendly.\n",
    "* It proides a level of abstraction, enabling us to change the internal implementation details without affecting the code that used that class\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to the principles of encapsulation, we can create classes that are more maintainable, modular, and less error-prone. It also promotes code reusability and helps manage the complexity of larger software projects."

    "**Answer:** Encapsulation is a key principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) together within a class. This cocepts promotes code maintainability and security by hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary methods to interact with its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Code Maintainability:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation enhances code maintainability by making it easier to understand, modify and debug code. By grouping related data and methodss together, it creates self-contained units that are easier to grasp and manage. This modularity allows developers to make changes to a class without affecting other parts of the program, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine a class that represents a bank account. Encapsulating the account balance and related methods within the class makes it clear how to interact with the account data. Developers can easily modify the implementation details of the account behavior without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Security:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation plays a crucial role in securing code by protecting sensitive data from unauthorized acces. By keeping data members private, encapsulation limits direct access to data, preventing external code from manipulating it directly. This controlled access reduces the risk of data breaches and ensures data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consider a class that stores user credentials. Encapsulating the usename and password within the class and providing methods to authenticate users protects these sensitive credentials from being directly accessed by other parts of the program. This approach safeguards user information and enhances the overll security of the application. "

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. Code Reusability:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Common Interfaces:**\n",
    "  * *Explanation:* Polymorphism allows us to create a shared interface for different classes. It's like having a universal remote for different TVs. No matter the branch (class), as long as it responds to the common buttons (methods), it work seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Method Overloading:**\n",
    "  * *Explanation:* It's akin to having a calculator with an 'add' button. Whether we're adding two or three numbers, we use the same button. In programming, it means using methods with the same name but adapting to differnt situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance:**\n",
    "  * *Explanation:* Think of it as building a family of classes. The parent class provides common features, and each child class inherits and extends those features. This way, we avoid duplicating code and establish a clear hierarhcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic Dispatch:**\n",
    "  * *Explanation:* Dynamic dispatch is like pressing buttons on a universal remote contro. The TV responds differently than the air coditioner, depending on the selected button. Similarly, in coding, actions depend on the actual type of the object at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Open-Closed Principle:**\n",
    "  * *Explanation:* It's similar to a toy box where we can keep adding new toys (classes) without modifying the old ones. The existing code remains closed (unchanged), while we extend its functionality with new classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loose Coupling:**\n",
    "  * *Explanation:* Loose coupling is like building with LEGO bricks. Each piece (class) works independently, and we can combine them in various ways without causing disruptions. It promotes modularity and ease of maintenance.\n",

    "**Answer:** In Python, the *'super()'* function is used to call the methods from the parent or superclass within a subclass. It is often used in the context of inheritance and polymorphims. Here's an explanation of how *'super()' works and how it helps in calling methods of parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of 'super()' in Python Polymorphism:\n",
    " 1. *Calling Parent Class Methods:*\n",
    "    * When a class inerits from anoter class, the subclass can override methods of the parent class. However, there are cases where your want to invoke the overridden method of the parent class from the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 'super()' allows you to call a method from the parent class, even if it has overridden in the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. *Method Resolution Order(MRO):*\n",
    "    * Python uses a method resolution order(MRO) to determines the order in which classes are searched when looking for a method. The 'super()' function utilizes the MRO to find the next class in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. *Polymorphism:*\n",
    "    * Ploymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to be used interchangeably. When a method is called using 'super()', it allows you to achieve polymorphic behavior by using the same method name in both the parent and subclass.\n",

    "**Answer:** *Dynamic polymorphism* is a concept in object-oriented programming where a single function, method, or perator can work with different types of objects, and the specific behavior is determined at runtime. This is achieved through a mechanism called late binding, where the decision of which method or function to call is made at runtime based on the actual type of the object.\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. **Method overriding:**\n",
    "   * Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, it is called method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Python supports dynamic polymorphism through method overriding. If a method is overridden in a subclass, the version of the method in the subclass is the one that gets executed when the method is called on an object of the subclass.\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. *Modularity:*\n",
    "* Abstraction lets you break down your big, scary code into these neat, maangeable pieces called classes. Each class does its own thing, keeping your code organized and tidy.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. *Code Reusability:*\n",

    "\n",
    " 4. *Easy Maintenance:*\n",
    "* When your code is nicely split into classes, fixing bugs or adding new features is a breeze. Change one class without worrying about breaking everything else. Less stress, more fun.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. *Scalability:*\n",
    "* Got big plans for your project? Abstraction is your growth spurt. You can keep adding new classes without turning your code into a hot mess. Perect for when your project hits the big leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. *Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:*\n",
    "* Abstraction is like a good team player. Different team member can work on different classes without stepping on each other's toes. It's teamwork without the drama.\n",
    "\n",
    " 7. *Readable AF:*\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Purpose of Abstract Methods:**\n",
    "    \n",
    " 1. *Blueprint for Classes:*\n",
    "    * Imagine you're building different types of vehicles, like car and bicycles. Before you start building, you create a bluepring that outlines what every vehicle should have - wheels, an engine, and so on. Abstract methods are like the required features listed in this blueprint.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. *Forcing Implementations:*\n",
    "    * When you create this bluepring, you don't provide the exact details of how each parts works. Abstract methods are placeholders for methods that every vehicle must have, but you leave them blank. This way, every specific vehicle (class) you build must fill in these blanks with its own unique ways of doing things.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 3. *Guidance for Builders:*\n",
    "    * Abstract methods guide the builders (programmers) by telling them, \"Hey, every vehicle must have these methods. You figure out how each methods works for your specific vehicle.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Enforcing Abstraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. *Hiding the Complicated Stuff:*\n",
    "    * Imagine you buy a remote-controller car. You don't need to know every wire and cicuits inside it to play with it. You just use the buttons on the remote. Abstract methods works similarly they hide the complicated stuff inside a class, so users (other parts of the program or other programmers) only need to know how to interact with it, not how it's implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. *Making Things Modular:*\n",
    "    * Think of abstract methods as building blocks. Each block (class) has its own specific way of doing things, and you can use these blocks together without worrying about how they were made. This makes your code more modular-like assembling different Lego pieces to create something bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. *Using Different Pieces Interchangeably:*\n",
    "    * Imagine you have different shapes - squares, circles, and triangles. You don't need to know how each calculate its area; you just know they all have an 'area' method. Abstract methods enable you to use different shapes interchangeably because they all adhere to the same set of rules, even though their implementations may be different.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In a nutshell, abstract methods are like placeholders in a blueprint. They guide programmers by saying, \"you must have these methods,\" but they don't provide the exact instructions. This allows for flexibility and consistency in building and using differnt parts of a program."

    "**Q18.** Explain how abstraction enhances code reusability and modularity in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Abstraction enhances code reusability and modularity in Python programs by providing a way to hide complex implementation details and focus on high-level concepts and interfaces. This makes it easier to reuse code across different parts of a program and promotes a modular structure that facilitates maintainability and scalability. Here's a breakdown of how abstraction achieves these benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. High- Level Interfaces:*\n",
    "* Abstraction allows you define high-level interfaces for differnet components or functionalities in your program.*\n",
    "* By creating abstract classes or interfaces, you specify what a certain part of he program should do without worrying about how it achieves it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Encapsulation of Details:*\n",
    "* Abstraction encapsulates implementation details within the components, hiding the complexity from the outside world.*\n",
    "* Users of a module or class only need to know how to interact with it through its abstracted interaface, not the internal workings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Code Reusability:*\n",
    "* Abstracting away implementation details promotes code reusability. A well-designed abstract component can be reused in various parts of a program or even in different projects.*\n",
    "* For example, if you have an abstract class representing a data access layer, you can reuse it in multiple modules without rewriting the database interaction code each time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Modularity:*\n",
    "* Abstraction encourages the creation of modular code, where each module or class has a well-defined purpose and interacts with other through clear interfaces.*\n",
    "* Modular code is like building with Lego blocks--you can swap out one block (module) for another without affecting the entire structure.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Isolation of Concerns:*\n",
    "* Abstracting componets helps in isolating concerns, meaning each module or class has a specific resposibility.*\n",
    "* This isolation makes it eaiser to understand and maintain code because you can focus on one part at a time without being overwhelmed by the entire program.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Ease of Maintenance:*\n",
    "* Because abstraction separates the interface from the implementation, making changes or updates to one part of the code doesn't necessarily impact the rest of the program.*\n",
    "* This ease of maintenance is crucial in large projects where modifications need to be made without introducing unintended side effects.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Scalability:*\n",
    "* Abstraction supports scalability by allowing you to add new features or expand functionalites without disrupting existing code.*\n",
    "* New modules or classes can be added, and existing ones can be extended without rewriting the entire program.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Collaborative Development:*\n",
    "* In a team environment, abstraction facilitates collaborative development. Team members can work on different modules independently as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon interfaces.*\n",
    "* Collaboration becomes more straightforward, and teams can focus on their specific areas without interfering with others.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Clear Division of Labor:*\n",
    "* Abstraction enables a clear division of labor among team members. Each person can be responsible for a specific module or class, making the development process more organized and efficient.*"

    "* It makes your code flexible. You can use different objects (like a Dog or a Cat) in the same way, even through they do different things internally.*\n",
    "* It's like having a universal remote that works with any device. You don't need a separate remote for each gadget.*\n",

    "Imagine you have a 'Sound Maker' gadget. You don't know how it works inside; you just know it has a 'Make Sound' button. You also have a 'Dog' and a 'Cat'. Both the 'Dog' and 'Cat' can use the 'Sound Maker' because they each know how to make their own sound. This is like method abstraction-hiding the complex stuff. And when you press the 'Make sound' button for the 'Dog' and 'Cat', that's like polymorphism-they each respond in their unique way.\n",

Composition is an alternative to inheritance, where you create a new class by incorporating existing classes rather than inheriting from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind composition is to create classes that are composed of other classes, forming a \"has-a\" relationship between them. This is in contrast to inheritance, which establishes as \"is-a\" realtionship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate composition in Python:"

    "In this example, the 'Car' class has a composition relationship with the 'Engine' class. Instead of inheriting from the 'Engine' class, an instance of the 'Engine' class is created within the 'Car' class using composition. This allows the 'Car' class to delegate the responsibility of starting the engine to the 'Engine' class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The 'Engine' class has a method 'start' that prints the 'Engine started.\"\n",
    " 2. The 'Car' class has an instance variable 'engine' that holds an object of the 'Engine' class.\n",
    " 3. The 'Car' class has a method 'start' that prints 'Car is starting...' and then delegates the task of starting the engine to the 'start' method of the 'Engine' class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This composition approach makes it easy to change or extend that beahvior of the 'Car' class without modifying the 'Engine' class. You can also easily reuse the 'Engine' class in other contexts.\n",

    "Composition provides a flexible and modular way to build complex objects, allowing you to assemble functionality from smaller, independent components. It promotes code reuse, maintainability, and separation of concerns in your codebase. \n"

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance:**\n",
    "* Think of it like a family tree. A child inherits traits from their parents. Similarly, in code, one class can inherit features (methods and properties) form another class. It's like saying a \"Car\" is a type if \"Vehicle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition:**\n",
    "* Picture it as putting Lego blocks together. You have different blocks with specific functions, and you combine them to build something bigger. In code, instead of saying one class is a type of another, you say one class has another as a part. For instance, a \"Car\" has an \"Engine.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Relationship Type:*\n",
    "* Inheritance is like saying \"a kind of.\"\n",
    "* Compositon is like saying \"has a part.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Code Reusability:*\n",
    "* Inheritance allows you to resue code from a parent class.\n",
    "* Composition lets you reuse components by putting them together.\n",

    "* Inheritance can lead to complex family trees of classes.\n",
    "* Composition keeps things simpler with modular blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Base Class Modification:*\n",
    "* Inheritance affects all children if you modify the parent.\n",
    "* Composition changes don't ripple through other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Ease of Debugging:*\n",
    "* Inheritance can be trickier to debug due to the family tree structure.\n",
    "* Composition is usually simpler to debug since classes are more independent.\n",

    "*Conclusion:*\n",

    "*1.Flexibility:*\n",
    "* **Aoviding Rigidity:** With composition, your code is more flexible. You can change how a class works without messing up its structure or affecting other classes. Inheritance can make your code more rigid and resistant to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mixing and Matching Components:** Components lets you easily mix and match different parts to create new functionalities. This is really handy for complex systems where you need to combine different behaviors in various ways.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Code Reusability:*\n",
    "* **Modular Components:** Composition encourages making smaller, reusable parts of your code. You can use these parts in different situations to build various things. It helps avoid writing the same code over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Easier Maintenance:*\n",
    "* **Isolation of Changes:** With composition, changes to one part usually don't mess up other parts. This makes it easier to understand and fix issues because you know where to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cleared Class Hierarchy:** Composition often leads to a simpler class structure. This makes your program easier to work with and less likely to have bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Enhanced Readability:*\n",
    "* **Clearer Intent:** When you see a class using composition, it's clear that it's putting different parts together for a specific purpose. This makes your code more readable because it shows what you're trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Favouring \"What it does\"over:\"What it is\":** Composition focuse on what an object does, not just what it is in the inheritance hierarchy. This can make your code more natural and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Reduced Coupling:*\n",
    "* **Loose Coupling:** Composition results in looser connections between classes. Changes in one parts are less likely to mess up other parts, making your system more flexible. This is good for testing and updating your code causing a lot of problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Delegation is a programming concept employed in composition where an object, known as a delegate, is responsible for handling specific tasks on behalf of another object. Unlike inheritance, which establishes as \"is-a\" relationship, delegation establishes a \"has-a\" relationship, allowing objects to reuse existing code and simplify the design of complex systems.\n",

    "5. *Easy Testing:*\n",
    "   * Delegation simplifies testing, as each class can be tested independently, and the intereactions between classes can be tested separately, facilitating issue identification and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Encapsulation:*\n",
    "   * Delegation encourages encapsulation by hiding the internal details of class from other classses, exposing only the necessary interfaces and defining clear boundaries between components.\n",

    "**Answer:** **Challenges and Drawbacks of Composition in Object-Oriented Programming:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Increased Complexity:*\n",
    "   * Composition can lead to increased code complexity as the number of classes and objects grows, making the system harder to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Tight Coupling:*\n",
    "   * Composition may result in tight coupling between objects, where changes in one component require modifications in others, potentially leading to cascade of updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Flexibility and Extensibility:*\n",
    "   * The flexibility and extensibility of the code may be compromised as hard-coded relationships between objects can hider modifications and extensions without impacting existing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Initialization Order:*\n",
    "   * Managing the initialization order of components is crucial, as improper handling can result in issues such as null refrence or incomplete objects states.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Performance Overhead:*\n",
    "   * Composition can reduce performance overhead due to the additional layers of indirection involved in accessing components, though modern environments are often optmized to mitigate this impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Learning Curve:*\n",
    "   * Developers, especially those new to the codebase, may face challenges in understanding the relationships between objects and the flow of control within a complex composition hierarchy.\n",

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhancing Code Maintainability and Modularity through Composition in Python Programs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compostion in Python plays a crucial role in improving code maintainability and modularity by adopting the design strategy that emphasizes the following key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Separation of Concerns:*\n",
    "   * Composition encouraes breakdown complex systems into smaller, focused components, forstering a clear separation of concerns. Each class or module can address a specific aspects of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Modularity:*\n",
    "   * The use of composition facilitates the development of modular code, where individual classes or modules encapsulate specific functionalities. This modular approach enhances code organization and ease of maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Code Reusability:*\n",
    "   * Composition promotes code reuse by allowing developers to compose new classes from existing ones, This reduces redudancy and enhances development efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Easy Maintenance:*\n",
    "   * With composition, maintenance tasks can be targeted to specific modules or classes, simplifying the overall process and minimizing the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Flexibility and Extensibility:*\n",
    "   * Composition provides flexibility for extending functionality without modifying existing code. New features can be added through the creation of new classes, adhering to the open-closed principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Readability and Understandability:*\n",
    "   * A well-composed codebase is inherently more readable and understandable. Composition allows for clear encapsulation of logic within classes, making it easier for developers to comprehend the structure and flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *Encapsulation:*\n",
    "   * Composition supports encapsulation, ensuring that the internal details of each class are hidden from external elements. This aid in creating well-defined interfaces and unintended dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. *Testing and Debugging:*\n",
    "   * Modular structures facilitated by composition simplify testing, allowing for focused unit testing of individual componenets. Debugging efforts can also be isolated to specifc modules, aiding in issue identification and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. *Scalability:*\n",
    "   * Composition facilitates scalable development, enabling the addition of new features through the introduction of newclasses without disrupting existing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. *Clear Hierarchies:*\n",
    "    * Composition encourages the creation of clear hierarchies in the code, with each level representing a different level of abstraction. This promotes a natural organization of the codebase."

    "**Q17.** Describe the concept of \"aggregation\" in composition and how it differs from simple composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept of Aggregation in Composition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggreation is a concept with composition that describes a relationship between objects wher one class contain another, but the objects involved maintain a more independent existance. Unlike simple composition, aggregation implies a \"has-a\" relationship, signifying that an object of one class is associated with objects of another class. The key distinctions lie in the flexibility of the relationship and the independence of the lifespan of the involved objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of Aggregation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Independence of Lifespan:*\n",
    "   * In aggregation, the contained class (the \"part\") can exist independently of the containing class( the \"whole\"). The lifespan of the contained object is not tightly bound to the lifespan of the containing object.\n",
    "   * If the containing object is destroyed, the contained object can persist, leading to a more flexible and loosely coupled relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Flexibility and Reusablity:*\n",
    "   * Aggregation provide greater flexibility and reusability, as the contained object can be associated with multiple instances of the containing class or reused in different contexts.\n",
    "   * This flexibility enhances the adaptability of the codebase, allowing for the composition of diverse relationships without tightly coupling the involved objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Multiplicity Representation:*\n",
    "   * In Unified Modeling Language(UML) diagrams, aggregation is often denoted by a diamond-shaped line connecting the classes. The multiplicity notation, such as \"0..\" or \"1..\", signifies there can be zero or more instances of the contained class associated with one instance of the containing class.\n",
